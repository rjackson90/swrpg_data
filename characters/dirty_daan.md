### Character Concept

```
Dirty Daan is not merely a man. 
He is a concept, a lifestyle, a brand. 
Bolder is better and better is best;
Push him too far and you'll die like the rest.

Quick with a blaster and quicker to drink,
you'll want him around when the group's on the brink
of disaster or glory his abilities are glorious!
However, his penchant for subtlety is notorious
for being completely and utterly lacking. 
Don't expect him to concoct plans or be good at hacking.

Or even to be a decent human creature.
He has no compassion nor morals and that's his best feature
for when you call Dirty Daan you'd best be hurting a lot
because when you call Dirty Daan what you get is an
assassination robot.
```

### Background

(Visionary Opportunists)
(The New Recruit)

    Dirty Daan is the moniker of a prototype assassination droid, modeled after the 
successful HK line of droids. Constructed 80 years prior to the Clone Wars, Dirty 
Daan's official designation is DTY-144n. Designed as a protocol droid by Danteel 
Yards, the model underwent numerous pre-production revisions in an effort to correct 
a persistent lack of empathy in the personality core. As time went on, the Yards 
fell on hard times and eventually abandoned the project and laid off the designers 
as available resources dried up. 

    One of the junior designers, furious at being fired by Danteel, took DTY-144n 
home where he reconfigured the droid into an assassination model. The persistent 
problems with a lack of empathy as well as a tendency to overheat when made to engage 
in high-level planning served the droid well in its new role. During the long months
during which the designer worked with DTY-144n, the pair grew to be fast friends and
DTY-144n acquired the nickname "Dirty Daan" due to his proclivity for low-brow humor
and prurient interests.

    The process of restoring Daan to a working state allowed the designer to
release his hatred for Danteel Yards and cancel his plans to send Daan to their
headquarters with furious anger and murderous intent. Instead, the designer began
renting out Daan to underworld clients as a way to make ends meet. Daan didn't mind
the arrangement as the work fulfilled his function and his persistent lack of
empathy shielded him from any negative psychological effects caused by his ever
climbing kill count. As great as his prowess in combat was, Daan relied upon his
designer to shield him from legal trouble. The designer was a shrewd fellow, and 
managed the finances of the operation while inventing a series of clever backstories
for Daan to throw off the occaisonal Republic investigator. 

    Things could not go on this way forever, and indeed they did not. As the years
dragged on, Daan was dismayed to see his human companion grow older and feebler 
with each passing decade. When the time finally came when the designer could no 
longer fulfill his part of the arrangement, Dirty Daan bid him farewell to seek his
fortune in the wider galaxy. Luckily for Daan, this departure came around the time
of the beginning of the destabilization of the Republic due to the machinations of 
then-Senator Palpatine. The increasing lack of order and increase in chaos made for
the perfect backdrop for Dirty Daan to continue his trademarked Dirty Deeds, at 
first continuing to work for private clients and then later taking the side of the
Republic during the Clone Wars in exchange for a pardon. 

    At the time of the deal, the Republic could only attribute perhaps a dozen or 
so murders to Dirty Daan, and likely would not have granted him a pardon had his 
true kill count, which at that time numbered in the low hundreds, had been known.
Regardless, Dirty Daan fought with distinction during the Clone Wars, though in his
own way with his own methods. Dirty Daan developed a reputation among Republic 
commanders as a capable droid who would nearly always deliver his target, but at a 
severe cost in the form of collateral damage, occaisonal friendly fire incidents, 
civillian casualites, ruined infrastructure, and wasted resources. The only thing
preventing Dirt Daan from being memory wiped and recycled was his ability to pull
off completely clutch manoevers and rescue many situations which were thought 
hopeless.

    Nonetheless, at the end of the war the newly forming New Order couldn't let 
Dirty Daan go fast enough. Pardon in hand, the assassin went back to his old ways,
heading back to the Outer Rim to lend his services to the scum and villiany of the
galaxy. However, this time the old haunts proved treasounous without the guidance 
and aid of his old mentor. Dirty Daan soon found himself being relentlessly pursued
by the new Imperial authorities. As the Empire tightened it's grip on the planets 
where Daan operated, he spent more and more of his time killing the imperials sent
to bring him to justice instead of the highly lucrative bounty contracts he was
programmed to fulfill. Relief finally came in the form of a contract to kill an 
officer in the Imperial Navy. Daan didn't know at the time that the contract was
being offered by a Rebel agent, and yet gladly accepted the agent's offer to join
the Rebellion at the contract's conclusion.
