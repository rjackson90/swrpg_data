# Dastardly Dan
## Oath Breaker, Risk Taker, Fortune Maker

### Character Concept

Dastardly Dan is not merely a man. 
He is a concept, a lifestyle, a brand. 
Bolder is better and better is best;
Push him too far and you'll die like the rest.

Quick with a blaster and quicker to drink,
you'll want him around when the group's on the brink
of disaster or glory his abilities are glorious!
However, his penchant for subtlety is notorious
for being completely lacking. 
Don't expect him to make plans or be good at hacking.

Or really even to be a decent human creature.
He has no compassion or morals and that may be his best feature
for when you Call Dastardly Dan you'd best be hurting a lot
because when you call Dastardly Dan what you get is an
assassination robot.
