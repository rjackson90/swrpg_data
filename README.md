# Data files for the playing of Star Wars RPGs

This repo contains characters, locations, NPCs, campaign ideas, and any other
information needed to have a good time playing one of Fantasy Flight Games' 
Star Wars roleplaying games. Feel free to use these materials in your own games,
but as they are primarily for my own use I will not accept pull requests.
